# Leandra-CPP-Projects

This repository is a compilation of all my coding assignments and projects completed from the beginning and end of my four-year undergraduate experience in C++.

### [LHallList.cpp](https://github.com/LeandraHall/Leandra-CPP-Projects/blob/main/LHallList.cpp)

This program will create a list of 32 random numbers. It will then print the original list, the sum of the numbers in the list,
the average of the numbers in the list, the largest and smallest number in the list, and the list in sorted order.
The terms List and array will be used interchangeably.

### [LHallQuadraticFormula.cpp](https://github.com/LeandraHall/Leandra-CPP-Projects/blob/main/LHallQuadraticFormula.cpp)

This program should solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula and return the solution to the user based on their input.

### [circle.cpp](https://github.com/LeandraHall/Leandra-CPP-Projects/blob/main/circle.cpp)

This program will calculate the area of a circle based on a user-inputted radius by utilizing a circle class with defined methods like getArea.

### [countingVowelsFunction.cpp](https://github.com/LeandraHall/Leandra-CPP-Projects/blob/main/countingVowelsFunction.cpp)

Using a function, this program should determine the number of vowels in an inputted string.
